# Python Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to guide you from beginner to proficient Python developer, starting with the fundamentals and building toward advanced concepts and practical applications.

## 1. Learn the Basics

### Start with the core syntax and foundational programming concepts.

- Basic Syntax

```py
print("Hello World")
```

- Variables and Data Types

### Variables
A variable is a simple container that holds a value. Think of it like a labeled jar where you can store something and use it later. The label is the name. The thing inside is the value.

### Why we use them
They let us reuse information, change information, and avoid repeating the same number or text everywhere in code. Without variables you cannot track anything.

### Example
```py
name = "John"
print(f"My name is {name}.")
print(f"{name} is married.")
print(f"{name} loves Biryani.")
print(f"{name} ate Biryani for 2 consecutive days.")
```
